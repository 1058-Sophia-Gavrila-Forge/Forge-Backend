# Getting Started
To edit the code start by doing a `git clone https://github.com/javatures/Forge-Backend.git` in gitbash inside the folder or directory you want the project to appear in on your local machine.

- Open VS Code and open the folder
- The following commands should be available provided you have Maven properly installed
    - `mvn spring-boot: run` runs the backend on your local machine
        - Keep in mind that a running instance of the frontend will not be able to communicate with the locally running instance of the backend.
    - `mvn test` runs the tests that have been written 
    - `mvn clean` cleans the workspace
    - `mvn build` builds the project
